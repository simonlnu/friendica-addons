Addon for Friendika to include MathJax (LaTeX math syntax)

This addon lets your users use LaTeX to type mathematical formulas
within their posts. MathJax takes care about the best method for the
browser to display the formula and provides compatibility to 99%
of the modern browsers.

You can either use the MathJax CDN online, thus loading the required javascript
libraries from the MathJax cloud, or use a local installation of MathJax.
Please see the plugin settings in the admin panel for configuration possibles.
If you don't set up a local MathJax instance, leave the configuration untouched
it will fall back to the MathJax cloud as default value.

If you don't use the admin panel add mathjax to the list of active addons

$a->config['system']['addon'] = [..., mathjax, ...]

To select the source of the included javascript libraries add a line

$a->config['mathjax']['baseurl'] = 'the URL to your MathJax installation';

to your .htconfig.php file. If this line is not there, the addon assumes that
you want to use the MathJax cloud (CDN).

Please note that your usage of the CDN is governed by the "MathJax CDN Terms of
Service" see http://www.mathjax.org/download/mathjax-cdn-terms-of-service/
